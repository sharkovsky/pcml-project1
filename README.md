# pcml-project1
Hi guys! This is our git repository for sharing code and for writing the report.
I suggest the following directory structure, let me know if you have any suggestions:
### report
this directory contains the latex source files and the instructions to compile the report.
Also, this directory should contain minimal scripts to regenerate the figures in the report, just in case.
I'll update a template soon.
### submission-code
this directory contains the version of the code we plan to submit.
### personal directories
A possibility is that each one of us has a personal directory where we can share code that is in intermediate state.
This might help us to avoid having to resolve many conflicts while merging, but in any case it would be best if each one of us also worked on a personal branch, and only put code in these repositories once the development is almost done.
